Each role has a dedicated functional dashboard with role-specific actions and restricted visibility.

## 🧩 Architecture & Code Structure

This project uses a **backend-separated clean architecture**.

Backend logic is isolated from UI to ensure:
- ✔ modularity
- ✔ secure access abstraction
- ✔ easier scaling
- ✔ future microservice migration compatibility

**Frontend communicates only through backend service functions** — no direct Firebase calls from components.

## 🎨 Design System

The platform uses a modern color palette:
- **Primary**: Orange (`#ff8000`) - For buttons, highlights, and interactive elements
- **Secondary**: Sage Green (`#74aa95`) - For secondary elements and success states
- **Accent**: Black (`#000000`) - For text and high-contrast elements

## 🔒 Security & Access Control

- Strict role-based access enforcement
- Department-wise data isolation
- Students can access:
  - ✔ their tickets
  - ✔ mapped lectures
  - ✔ syllabus-based AI
- Teachers manage uploads & responses
- HOD & Admin receive workflow visibility
- Sensitive data never exposed publicly
